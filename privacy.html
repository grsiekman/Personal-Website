I do not use analytics or any other tools to monitor user behavior or collect data about you. Since the website does not collect any user information, I have no user information to share with or sell to third parties.<br> If you engage with the dark mode switch, the site will use local storage to store your preference and your first switch click on your device. This allows your theme preference to persist every time you return to the site. The switch click data is stored to prevent the site from serving the privacy pop up after you've already seen it once. As this is local storage, I don't/can't collect any information from this. If you wish to remove this after interacting with the switch, <a href="#" id="lsWipe">click here</a>. By default, the website attempts to set theme based on your system theme preferences.<br> If you have any questions or concerns about any of this, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:webmaster@siekmang.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webmaster@siekmang.com</a>.<br><br>
